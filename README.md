# DESCRIPTION
This repository contains the full solution for Internship Task 3, developed as part of a data science internship program. The goal of this task is to design, implement, and evaluate a machine learning classification model using Python. It follows a complete end-to-end pipeline, starting from loading the dataset to generating accurate predictions and evaluating the results. This notebook demonstrates a solid understanding of the core steps involved in building a predictive model, including data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and performance evaluation.

The project uses widely adopted Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms. During the analysis, categorical variables are encoded, missing values are handled, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure proper model validation. Various classification algorithms—such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest (based on the dataset requirements)—are trained and compared to determine which model provides the best performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure the effectiveness of each model.

The notebook is clearly structured and includes comments and explanations at each step, making it easy for beginners to understand the flow of the project. Visualizations are included to provide better insight into the data distribution and relationships between features. This task also helps to build familiarity with practical issues in machine learning, such as data imbalance, overfitting, and choosing the right metrics for classification problems.

This project is ideal for students, interns, or anyone starting in the field of data science who wants hands-on experience with a real-world classification problem. It can also serve as a great addition to a personal portfolio, demonstrating skills in data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The repository is open for contributions, and users are encouraged to fork or clone the project to explore further improvements, try additional algorithms, or even apply the same process to other datasets.

To run the notebook, make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can easily run it using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. This task not only highlights technical knowledge but also showcases how to present data science projects in a clean, organized, and professional manner.
